# ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application

For now, the major emphasis relies on the back-end. The primary objectives are as follows:
* *Being able to create an account and store the data in a database*
* *Incorporate messaging functionality between two users*

I've added basic styling to a welcome page, even though, it will be improved in a final release. This styling was created to serve a mere purpose of being quite good-looking during a development time frame but I really enjoy it now due to the **responsive** nature and **SVG** elements which I've included. :heart_eyes:
